# 🧬 Doubly-Even Code Playground

This is a lightweight JavaScript playground to explore **doubly-even self-dual binary error-correcting codes** — the kind of codes that surprisingly appeared in **supersymmetric physics equations** studied by Dr. James Gates Jr.

> It's weird, beautiful, and it kinda makes you wonder if the universe is... debugging itself?

This project was born from a personal curiosity — a mix of philosophy, code, and physics. If you're a dev who loves cosmic rabbit holes, you're in the right place.

## 💡 From Dev Curiosity to Theoretical Physics

It might sound wild, but the simple logic behind my C++ parity checker — which just adds `1`s until the total count is divisible by 4 — mirrors some very deep math found in **string theory** and **supersymmetry**.

Let me break it down in dev-friendly terms:

---

### 🤖 What My Code Does (in Math Terms)

- Takes a binary string like `"1011"`.
- Checks if the number of `1`s is divisible by 4 → this makes it **doubly-even**.
- If not, adds the minimum number of `1`s needed to make it valid.

In math speak, it's working with **binary linear codes** that are:

- **Self-dual** (they equal their own orthogonal complement),
- **Doubly-even** (every valid codeword has a number of 1s divisible by 4).

These types of codes are crucial in **error correction**, ensuring data integrity in systems like memory, satellites, and deep-space transmissions.

### 🧠 What string theory does (mathematically)

In advanced string theory and **supersymmetric** models, physicists use:

- **Algebraic structures** (like Lie algebras),
- **Operators** that follow strict symmetry rules,
- **Adinkras** (graphical representations of SUSY equations),
- And — surprise — **binary codes** to constrain possible transformations.

While working with these, Dr. James Gates Jr. discovered patterns **identical** to digital error-correcting codes — specifically, **doubly-even self-dual binary block codes**.

One famous example? The **Golay Code** — a code used in real-world error correction and also in string theory models.

### 🌀 So What Does That Mean?

The fact that a bit-counting rule in a toy C++ program **naturally appears** in the math of the universe?

That’s amazing.

It suggests the universe might be **structured in a way that’s computational** — with built-in logic to correct, constrain, and preserve consistency.

And if that’s true... maybe writing code is one small way to **read the source**.

## 🚀 What This Code Does

- ✅ Accepts a binary input string (e.g., `1011`)
- 🧠 Checks if the number of `1`s is divisible by 4 (i.e., doubly-even)
- ➕ Adds minimal `1`s to make the code valid if needed
- 🖥️ Runs entirely in the browser — no build tools or dependencies

## 📦 How to Run Locally

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doubly-even-code-checker.git
cd doubly-even-code-checker
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser (it works offline, no server needed).

## 🧠 Bonus: C++ Version

If you're into lower-level logic or exploring how this could map to WebAssembly, check out `parity_checker.cpp`.

To compile and run it locally:

```bash
g++ parity_checker.cpp -o parity
./parity
```

It follows the same logic as the JS demo — great for CLI enthusiasts.
